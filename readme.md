##Kirby?
[Kirby](http://getkirby.com) is a lightweight, flexible and file-based CMS made by [Bastian Allgeier](http://bastianallgeier.com). If you want to learn more about Kirby, visit the Kirby Website and check out the [docs](http://getkirby.com/docs)!

##How to install the theme
After [installing Kirby](http://getkirby.com/docs/getting-started) just remove the default **assets**, **content** and **site** folder and replace it with the downloaded ones from Baseblog. For optional interface usage you have to install the [Kirby Panel](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-panel/).
